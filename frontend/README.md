# FinanceFlow — frontend

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React frontend skeleton.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies inside `frontend`:

   npm install

2. Run the dev server:

   npm run dev

Notes

- Vite is configured to proxy `/api` to `http://localhost:4000` (backend).
- You may want to run the backend server concurrently while developing.
